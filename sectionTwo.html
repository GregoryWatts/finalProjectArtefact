                    To make coffee there are many ways to make it 2 are mentioned here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One Method is through a french press also known as a cafetiere. The way it works is that the coffee grounds
                    are placed into the press a big container essentially and then hot water is then mixed with it. After around
                    5 minutes its ready to be poured through a filter into a mug.

                    <br>
                    Second Method is a pour over system. It is when coffee grounds are placed in a metal or paper filter. Then water
                    is poured over it for it to filter the coffee through to then be poured into a mug to drink.
